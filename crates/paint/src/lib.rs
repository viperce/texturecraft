//! # texturecraft-paint

//! The brush engine. A [`Stroke`] turns pointer samples into world-space [`Stamp`]s (picking,
//! lazy mouse, spacing along the surface, jitter, symmetry); [`raster::rasterize`] accumulates
//! them into a texture-space stroke alpha over the UV G-buffer, hiding surfaces the camera can't
//! see ([`EyeDepth`]); [`commit`] blends the finished stroke into layer pixels. Clone and smudge
//! strokes carry channel values ([`pickup`]) instead of painting the tool's material.
//! [`path`] samples the Path tool's curves and lasso coverage; [`particles`] runs the particle
//! brush; [`alphas`] is the built-in library of procedural brush alphas and [`presets`] the built-in
//! brush presets; [`text`] draws text for text alphas and decals.
